Titanic Survival Prediction Model
This project involves building and evaluating machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic based on various features. The analysis and model building are documented in the Jupyter notebook "Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Model_Updated.ipynb".



Installation
To run the code in this project, you need to have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
You can install these packages using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Model_Updated.ipynb.
Run the cells in the notebook to execute the analysis and model building steps.
Data Loading and Exploration
This section covers loading the Titanic dataset and performing initial exploration to understand its structure and contents.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performing EDA to identify patterns and insights from the data. This includes visualizations and summary statistics.

Handling Missing Values
Strategies for dealing with missing data in the dataset, including imputation techniques.

Outliers Detection and Treatment
Identifying and treating outliers in the dataset to improve model performance.

Model Building
Linear Regression
Building a linear regression model to predict survival.

Multiple Linear Regression
Extending the linear regression model to include multiple features.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Building and evaluating a K-Nearest Neighbors model for survival prediction.

Evaluation
Evaluating the performance of the models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.

Conclusion
Summarizing the findings and discussing the performance of different models.

Acknowledgments
This project is based on the famous Titanic dataset, which is available on Kaggle. Special thanks to the Kaggle community for providing the dataset and inspiration for this project.
